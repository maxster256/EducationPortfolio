            <h3>Extra-curricular activities</h3>
            <p>There's quite a lot of stuff to mention here, frankly, so I've focused mostly on some major projects of mine, starting from the most recent work.</p>
            <div class="course">
                <h4 class="course-header">Ogólnopolski Kongres Młodzieżowych Rad i Sejmików</h4>

            <div class="course">
                <h4 class="course-header">Youth Parliament of Dolny Śląsk</h4>
                <p>I've been a member and the Chairman of the MSWD and I've worked on varios topics regarding the regional youth policy and the organization's inner structure and culture.</p>
                <p>Foreign policy was one of my top priorities, and I've visited quite a few foreign places in order to find some good practices and share the experiences..</p>
                <p>Currently I'm the PR and Communications Coordinator at the parent organization, Semper Avanti.</p>

                <h4 class="course-header">Machine Learning</h4>
                <p>During some free time I've been trying to learn about various machine learning algorithms, as I'm quite passionate about the topic in general. Possible applications are just so awesome!</p>
                <p>I've applied for the Santander Scholarship for the project, which would involve time series forecasting for Lower Silesian Railways and other public transport companies using recurrent neural networks.</p>

                <p>In the Junior High School I became very passionate about movies and have directed quite a few, short movies with my friends.</p>
                <p>One of them, called Romeo and Juliet had won the national contest "Lektury w Kadrze". It was said that the movie was very strong on the technical side.</p>
