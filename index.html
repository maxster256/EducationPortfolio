            <h3>Howdy, stranger!</h3>
            <p>On this site you will find some stuff regarding the courses that I've attended during my studies, as well as some info on my extra-curricular activities.
            </p>
            <p>I did my best to make sure the stuff here wouldn't be boring as hell, so make sure to give me some credit here and there.</p>
            <h4>About the site</h4>
            <p>The site was written in pure HTML 5 and CSS 3 with the mobile-first approach. In terms of the rules applied here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast is applied as much as possible, though the site is mostly kept in minimal fashion.</li>
                <li>Repetitions are pretty much omnipresent here, but without too much excess.</li>
                <li>Aligment of the elements is carefully planned, with the Golden Rule and the common sense especially kept in mind.</li>
                <li>Proximity of the objects which belong to the same group is kept.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The negative space is used to make some room for breathing, and the colors are used to draw the user's attention to the UI features.</p>
            <p>No frameworks or other technologies were used here apart from the beforementioned.</p>
